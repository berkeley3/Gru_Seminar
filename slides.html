# Machine Learning in healthcare 
&lt;img src="slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Growth of publications in PubMed with term _machine learning_
- Exponentiated regression of log number of publications on year is used to predict the future trend 

---
# What is Machine Learning

- Machine learning teaches computers to do __learn__ from experience
    - Machine learning algorithms use computation methods to _learn_ information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation to model

- The algorithms adaptively improve their performance as the number of data samples available for learning increases


---
# How Machine Learning works

__Different types of Learning__

- Supervised Learning
  - output is known and it is used during the training process
- Unsupervised Learning
  - output is not provided during the training
- Other type of Learning
  - Semi-Supervised Learning
  - Reinforcement Learning

# When using Machine Learning

- Large, multi-dimensional and heterogeneous dataset
- Aimed at extracting knowledge
  - we know a pattern exists
- Complex task or problem for which there is not a (recommended) mathematical approach
- Large collections of data are available
  - data driven approach
- Limited prior knowledge

  - age, sex, nationality 
  - day of the week, of hospital admission, time of arrival, triage color
  - ICD9, final diagnosis, medication prescribed and diagnostic test
  - mode of discharge (at home, to a ward, ...), time lapse between 1st and 2nd visit

# Potential applications to chronic disease conditions

---
# Q-learning in healthcare

-  Growing segment of elderly living longer with chronic health conditions 
    - more likely to experience multiple transitions from hospital to home that negatively affect their quality of life and consume substantial healthcare resources

- Analyses attempting to identify patients at risk of readmission are mainly focused on the single re-hospitalization 
    - they fail to incorporate multiple hospital readmissions and admissions in community services that characterize a chronic condition
       
- Need of multistate models that considers all clinical pathways and  assesses their potential dependence on covariates 
  - multiple hospitalization readmission, home/residential care activations 

---
# Aims

- Assessing the effect of certain clinical conditions in a community setting on multiple readmissions by including intermediate care services  
- Enhancing understanding of the clinical pattern of patients with chronic conditions for adverse prognosis 
    - it can help implementing appropriate intervention strategies 
    
- Identifying the global risk profile of patients with clinical complexities according to their transition patterns 
  - Identifying clinical factors associated with different transitions, i.e. admission, discharge and death 
- To date, multi-state (statistical) models have been applied for estimating both competing and recurrent events
  - oncological patients

- loss function L such that `\(Q_0\)` minimized the risk `\(P_0L(Q)\equiv E_0L(Q)(0)\)`

# Two stage methodology
1. __Super learning__ (M.J van der Lan et al. 2007, E. Polley et al 2012)
  - uses a library of candidate estimators (parametric models and machine learning algorithms, i.e. neural networks, RandomForest, etc)
  - builds data-adaptive weighted combination of estimators using cross validation (_ensemble model_)

2. __Targeted estimation__ (M.J van der Lan et al. 2006)
  - Update initial estimate to remove bias for the parameter of interest 
  - Update based on parametric submodel through initial estimate with score equal to efficient score/efficient influence curve
  - Calculate final parameter from updated fit of the data-generating distribution
---
# Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation
- Regress outcome on past
`$$Y\sim L_0 + L_1 + T_0 + T_1$$`
  - take predictions setting `\(T_0=t_0\)` and `\(T_1=t_1\)`
  - update predictions using `\(g_{0:1}=\Pi_{t=0}^1 g_t\)`

- Regress updated prediction `\(\hat Y^2\)` on past to previos period
    - `\(\hat Y^2 \sim L_0 + T_0\)`
    - take predictions setting up `\(T_0\)`
     - update predictions using `\(g_0\)`
- Take average of prediction `\(\hat Y^1\)` over `\(L_0\)`

# Properties

.pull-left[
- It requires you specify the correct propensity score model
  - If outcome-exposure mechanism estimated using a misspecified model
- Subject to bias and high variance with moderate to strong confounding
  - When certain treatment or exposure levels of interest are rare/absent for some patients
]
.pull-right[
- Minimize bias due to model misspecification
  - Double robust
  - Consistent 
- Maximize precision of effect estimates
  - Efficient (minimal asymptotic variance in semi-parametric model)
- May reduce bias and variance compared to IPTW
- Exploits Machine Learning for model specification
